# ”Startup Name Generator” App

A simple app that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates 10 names at a time. As the user scrolls, more names are generated. There is no limit to how far a user can scroll. This app will contains the stateful List view which contains the names as an items.

I added favorites List features to that app. User can add/remove names to their favorites list. Any number of names can be saved. I added Favorites Icon to the all items of List view. User can add names in their favorites list using that Icon.
